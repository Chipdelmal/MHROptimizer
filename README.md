# MHR Optimizer

These scripts were created as a tool to optimize hunting routes in "[Monster Hunter Rise](https://www.monsterhunter.com/rise/)".

Right now, the main routine takes in the list of the monsters/resources required, and returns the dictionary of locations where they can be found. 
An extension to provide the raw materials to be found is being developed.
